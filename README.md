### Different types of coordinate systems 
- Cartesian Coordinates 

![catrtesian coordinates](images/cartesian.png)
  - The traditional x and y coordinate system. 
  - If X and Y are measured in same units, then they must have same spacing between ticks.

- Non linear axis
![Non linear transformation](images/non_linear_transformation.jpeg)
  - We transform the value of a given axis, using functions like log, square root. 
  - This is useful to suite the graph according to the story, or when the range of the values of quite large. 
  - Also used to display the values which uses mulitplication or division in them.
